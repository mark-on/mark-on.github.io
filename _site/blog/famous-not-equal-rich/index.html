  <h1 id="heading">Famous not equal Rich</h1>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Would you rather be rich and unknown or poor and famous?<br>
This could seem a stupid question, but understanding the answer can help us make a model about how modern society has a weird correlation with money and fame.<br>
While having money can let you be less anxious and economically independent, I cannot understand the pros of only being famous.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;We crave attention over freedom&quot;</strong></p>
<h2>Being famous in the digital era</h2>
<p>A lot of people nowadays, in the era of narcissism, are craving to be famous only for the joy of being recognized and appreciated (so sad).</p>
<p>How often do we see people ridicule themselves just for the sake of having this spotlight for a millisecond on their head? Why do they do that — money or fame?</p>
<p>If you open YouTube or TikTok it's full of social-network climbers that, instead of reaching a higher social class, want to reach your landing page.<br>
We can obviously say that they do that to be noticed, but do they do this for getting richer too? Sure! Let's not forget that, first of living in a narcissistic society, we're living in a late-stage capitalist one.<br>
So we can say that making content and trying to reach as many people as we can is a way to reach &quot;the attention&quot; and use that for making money.</p>
<p>When we talk about famous people we think of football players, actors, politicians (for god's sake they're the worst — they deserve a whole blog post about how they've just become influencers and not leaders) and we see them as wealthy people.<br>
So, first of all, it's ridiculous to discuss how some of them have gained money, lost it, and become broke. It's not interesting; it's about bad decisions or not managing the heritage at best.</p>
<p>With the sentence <em>Famous not equal Rich</em> I'm talking about people that, after becoming famous, had the need of transforming their followers into money.</p>
<p>I think that the main reason for this attention plague is connected to how being more connected leads us to be more dissociated.<br>
We can say that this is not so different from money.</p>
<p>Why do we love luxury and being rich? We don’t love it because we can achieve freedom or help poor people; we do it because being rich means being like the few who control the world.</p>
<p>In a world full of workers and people struggling to pay rent, being rich means having a numbered value that defines your position in the world — and we often tend to think that richer people are better people too, which is logically unproven — making you feel above others.</p>
<p>With fame, it’s not that different: followers are the new dollars.<br>
In a connected world where everyone is on social media, being famous simply means that there are more people following you than people you follow, letting us feel more intelligent and interesting than the majority of people.</p>
<p>We haven’t really changed that much from the early sapiens: to choose the “alpha,” we now measure money and fame instead of muscles.</p>
<p>So, if we want to be the neo-futuristic “alpha person” we think we deserve to be, we need to become rich and famous.</p>
<h2>How to become rich and famous</h2>
<p>If you want to become famous — without going on the news as a killer — you have two roads:</p>
<ol>
<li>Good communication</li>
<li>Become a meme</li>
</ol>
<p>If you're good at communicating you will go higher, but this is a slow road and, in the current world, hard work is not a virtue.<br>
We don't have time and we're not that good at making content and stuff — we want to be famous NOW.</p>
<p>If we need to achieve this goal the fastest road is to become a meme, but maybe it's even harder.<br>
It's like saying: &quot;It's easier to make one million betting or making a company?&quot;</p>
<p>In the sense of something that can be replicated and is directly proportional to our study and research, good communication is easier;<br>
in the sense of not wanting to improve ourselves, becoming a meme is easier but random.</p>
<p>One of the latest cases of fast and random popularity we have encountered is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFnV3qDpNLY">Hawk Tuah Girl</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Italy we call them <em>Trash Phenomena</em>: here's an old <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsokgja5o6M">example</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a critical eye, we can't see anything abnormal: a guy was making a fun video and one clip became popular.<br>
Maybe the clip became famous because it was funny, or maybe because we always see girls as people who should be more polite and not talk about sexual stuff (patriarchy stuff, sorry women, our fault).<br>
But what we surely know is that this girl became a <em>meme</em>.</p>
<h2>Famous and poor, let's become rich</h2>
<p>We can see a pattern.<br>
People that randomly become famous — often not even with their own platform or on purpose — without a real structure, cannot sustain the notoriety as a personal project or a company.<br>
In other words, <strong>they become famous but not rich.</strong></p>
<p>After that video reached all the screens in the world, you have some untapped potential.<br>
After you become famous you want to stay at the top of the wave, so you need to iterate the same process of how to become famous — <em>but every day</em> (it's an iterative function).</p>
<p>If you have no entrepreneurial skills, one of the ways is to become the meme of yourself: take what made you famous and repeat it to infinity.<br>
If you need to pay the bills you can even make some appearances at parties, or even make a song or some merch.</p>
<p>She made, for example, a podcast, trying to make discussable content with even more discussable guests called <em>Talk Tuah</em>.<br>
After that, she launched a cryptocurrency that didn’t go so well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For those who missed it (lucky you), Hawk Tuah girl, Hailey, went from viral sensation to crypto scandal after launching her $HAWK meme coin in late 2024.<br>
The coin soared to a ridiculous $490 million market cap, only to crash down by over 90 percent in mere hours, leaving her viewers — and some with less-than-healthy bank accounts — shocked and pissed off.<br>
The backlash was brutal as people complained about losing their life savings.<br>
Yes, really. One person even posted about losing a whopping $35,000, and the internet was not kind.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>If you're a good communicator you can exploit the light out of the spotlight to extract as much visibility as you can and create your own fanbase.<br>
One example of good communication and creation of structure was Charlie Kirk.</p>
<p><em>I don't share his ideology and as a European what happened was crazy for me, but through his communication skills, he reached what he wanted.</em></p>
<p>He became famous with these provocative videos talking about sensitive stuff and responding to people in Q&amp;A sessions.<br>
After that, he shaped his own fanbase and used it for his purpose.</p>
<p>For politics, you can change reaching money with reaching people aligned with your political view.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My idea is that using illogical and gut-feeling responses helped him to reach celebrity.<br>
If you were against him, you probably helped him by commenting or talking (even in a bad way) about him.<br>
His purpose was not to say the right stuff but, day after day, to attract as many people aligned with his political view and engage them on his own platform (social networks).<br>
If you become a meme it's easier to reach as many people with your alignment as you can.</p>
<p><em>&quot;So popular they can't ignore you.&quot;</em> (Sorry Mr. Newport)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have seen how being famous doesn't mean becoming rich, but there is a way of converting those numbers into coins (idk, coin sounds funny).<br>
It shows how sick our society really is.</p>
<p>What I find interesting is that, if some years ago, people would have fought for positions in society that gave them power and wealth,<br>
now I see how people are feeding their narcissistic behavior through systems that use that sense of (fake) empowerment just to let big tech companies use them for making money (and collective data — another name to call money) just as much as they do for everyone.</p>
<p>The next time you see a meme becoming a brand, just remember that the only ones who are gaining money from it are the big tech companies, no one else.</p>
<p>So maybe the only lesson I would like to give you is this one:</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Please, close that fucking TikTok, make yourself a favor.&quot;</strong></p>
