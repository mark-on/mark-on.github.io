# Hello there, I'm Mark!<br>
Nice to meet you and welcome to my space station. You've traveled a lot before you got here so please, take a break.<br><br>

I'm a computer science student and my intent with this website is to share knowledge, thoughts, experiences and connect with people.<br>
Day after day you will see my goals and my own view of the world forms. You will see a man taking the journey of life, changing ideas and forming new ones. This is the start of THE project and I would love to share it with you.<br><br>

# MANIFESTO<br>
This is my manifesto, a mission statement of my values, that I will share with you. I will express my ideology, ideas and points of view.<br><br>

## Honesty above all<br>
I think that people nowadays lack honesty and it's so annoying. No one has the balls to tell you the truth. My goal here is to be as much non-biased as I can (and I need your help too).<br><br>

## Sharing as much as you can<br>
If I needed to pay for everything useful I've taken from people's knowledge, today I would probably be broke (as if I were not...). I think that as much as I need knowledge, I need to spread it, even if it's just organizing other people's thoughts for you.<br><br>

## Critical Thinking as a Duty<br>
The world is full of people thinking as little as they can. Using your brain for solving daily tasks and forming opinions has become worthless. We're letting people choose for us: politicians, influencers, friends, and algorithms. This blog is my rebellion. I will dissect ideas, question myself and prioritize logic over convenience. It's hard work, but it's the only way to true clarity.<br><br>

## BE FREE<br>
The range of fields where the word freedom needs to be applied is endless. I want to focus on the freedom of expression. This place is not only mine, it's yours too and you're free to let me know your ideas and thoughts about everything here. To be free shouldn't be a luxury of a few, but the bare minimum of common living.<br><br>

This site isn't dead yet, come here often.<br>
If you want to travel in the station, there are some useful portals. Why walk if you can teleport yourself everywhere you want to go?<br><br>
