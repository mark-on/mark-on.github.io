# Hello there, I'm Mark!<br>

Nice to meet you and welcome to my space station. You've traveled a lot before you got here so please, take a break.<br><br>



I'm a computer science student and my intent with this website is to share knowledge, thoughts, experiences and connect with people.<br>

Day after day you will see my goals and my own view of the world forms. You will see a man taking the journey of life, changing ideas and forming new ones. This is the start of THE project and I would love to share it with you.<br><br>
