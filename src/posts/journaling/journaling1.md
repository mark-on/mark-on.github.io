This is my very blog post.
That's so weird, writing for the first time not only for my self but for the hope that someone could read it (by mistake, let's be real). The website isn't even deployed on the web and I'm already thinking how people could judge my blog.

So, let's start about describe how I'm thinking to design this blog.
I thought about this blog as a collection of writings and journaling - posts like this one -.
- **writings**: collection of posts made with some cure and research. The purpose of this section is to dissect ideas, articulate thought using facts and a bit of brain (just a bit).
- **journaling**: day by day posts (probably non everyday, I'm busy overthinking about the writing posts on this blog) where i describe my life by the career and self development point of view. I don't want to journal like a teen girl sad about their first love ; more like a grown adult crying about the fucked up job market.

So kinda easy right? That's the problem, i don't really know if it's too much of a simplification. 
My idea of blogging was to have this kind of posts: 
- essays: posts made for the purpose of analyze an idea or making some research about it
- blog post: shorter posts made for the purpose of explaining and idea, forming a thought.
- writings: long variable posts about everything, including drafted post.

We will try this way.
I'm thinking of curse about improving the UI Design,, i don't like it very much.
I would like to understand the best way of doing it, so if you want to give me some advices or opinion, be free to contact me: [markonblog@gmail.com](mailto:markonblog@gmail.com)
